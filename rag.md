# RAG - Retrieval augmented generation #

## What is RAG? ##
RAG is a model that combines retrieval and generation in a single model. It is based on the idea of using a retriever to retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus and then using a generator to generate the answer based on the retrieved passages. The retriever is used to narrow down the search space and provide relevant context to the generator, which can then generate more accurate and coherent answers.

## 1. Indexing ##
The first step in using RAG is to index the corpus of documents that will be used for retrieval. This involves converting the documents into a format that can be efficiently searched and retrieved. The documents are typically indexed using a search engine like Elasticsearch, which allows for fast and efficient retrieval of relevant passages.

- Numerical representation of the text:
  - **Splitting**: The documents is split into smaller units to satisfy context windows.
